# Dextro is coming to DevUE
by DevGames
March 7, 2023



DevUE is releasing with Update v1.37! Read more in this blog post.


DevUE (Devnite Unreal Editor) is a editor to create games for Devnite! You can use the editor to create nice Battle Royale Maps, Exploration maps or other maps. The editor gives you full control...



## DevUE vs UE
DevUE is a unreleased UE4 version (UE4.27 plus). We modified it so it is working with Devnite, we added [Dextro](https://dev.dgames.org/docs/dextro) coding language, C++ support and Python. DevUE is released in BETA which means some functions aren't available yet (Dextro edit history, Dextro docs in editor and more).


Also DevUE is different than UEFN! While UEFN is limited to asset types we give access to game asset types like:
- Playlists
- Gamemode selection
- World Settings
- and more



## Adding C++ classes
To create a c++ class goto "Project > Create C++ Class". After this select a type and enter a name. When you are done DevUE will open your prefered IDE and the code will look like this:
```csharp
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "ClassName.generated.h"
  
UCLASS()
class ClassName : public UObject
{
	GENERATED_BODY()
	
};
```

You can find more information on the [Dextro Documentation](https://dev.dgames.org/docs/dextro) or on the [DevUE Documentation](https://dev.dgames.org/docs/devue/getting-started).
