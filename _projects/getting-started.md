BETA  inventory


The Devnite Creative Inventory is similar to the FNC Inventory. We have [Prefabs](htpps://dev.tfngames.tk/docs/using-prefabs), [Galleries](htpps://dev.tfngames.tk/docs/using-galleries), [Devices](htpps://dev.tfngames.tk/docs/using-devices) and the [Library](#using-the-library). 


# Using Playsets

With playsets you can spawn prefabs, galleries or devices!

With the "My Library" tab you can download prefabs from GitHub and [create](https://dev.tfngames.tk/docs/dnc/create-your-first-playset) your own Playset.

## Download GitHub playsets
To download playsets via GitHub use the following steps:
1. Visit the playset repo
2. Copy the SSH line (Example: git@github.com:devgames/thebeginning.git)
3. Open the "My Library" tab in DNC
4. Press "Add playset" and paste the SSH
5. Finally press "Clone playset repo"
