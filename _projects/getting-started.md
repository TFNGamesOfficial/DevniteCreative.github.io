BETA  inventory


The Devnite Creative Inventory is similar to the FNC Inventory. We have [Prefabs](htpps://dev.tfngames.tk/docs/using-prefabs), [Galleries](htpps://dev.tfngames.tk/docs/using-galleries), [Devices](htpps://dev.tfngames.tk/docs/using-prefabs) and the [Library](htpps://dev.tfngames.tk/docs/using-library-in-dnc). 


## Using the Library

With the "My Library" tab you can download prefabs from GitHub and [create](https://dev.tfngames.tk/docs/dnc/create-your-first-playset) your own Playset.
